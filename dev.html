            <h3>FexiOS</h3>
            <p>
                FexiOS is a work-in-progress operating system meant for personal computers
                with modularity and "low-cost" performance in mind. It will try to combine
                the ease of use of Windows with the system control and modularity of GNU/Linux.
                Users will be able to make their own world inside their operating system and
                customize their experience to their own will with "no-code" or "low-code"
                solutions. Of course not everyone feels like fiddling with their system for
                a few hours, so FexiOS will offer sensible defaults or presets mimicking
                the familiar feel of their Windows or MacOS environments.
            </p>

            <h3>SGL (Seagull)</h3>
            <p>
                SGL (SDL GUI Library), or by it's more easily pronouncable name Seagull, is
                a GUI libray for C++ that utalizes SDL. SDL is just a cross-platform library
                for interracting with I/O devices from your PC. It started out when I was
                trying to make a simple C / C++ user interface for an app, but I realized
                it's way more complex than it needs to be. Using popular libraries can be a
                nightmare, especially because quite a few of them are deprecated or abandoned.
                Things like Qt and WxWidgets gave me many headaches so I completely gave up
                on using them. Other options aren't cross-platform or they miss basic
                funcionality, so I set out to make my own library. Using
                <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">
                    SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
                </a>
                the library would easily work on all popular platforms, and setting SGL up
                would be as simple as setting up SDL and downloading a header file.
            </p>
            <h5>Development status - Temporarily halted</h5>
            <p>
                Currently the library is semi-abandoned, but I plan on coming back
                to it in the future with a re-code from scratch. Currently the library
                relies on C++ exclusive code, which I do not like since I'm a fan of C
                and I want it to work in C. Initially I chose C++ because it supported
                OOP, but I've grown to dislike C++ entirely. The library will probably
                make it's way into FexiOS when GUIs will be needed.

            <h3>Cudoku</h3>
            <p>
                Cudoku is a CLI recursive Sudoku solver written in C (hence the name Cudoku).
                It relies on Sudoku having a limited number of possibilities so, as dumb
                as it may sound, it just tries them all until it finds a solution.
                That may sound slow, but modern CPUs run at 3-5 GHz so it's capable of
                solving any puzzle in mere milliseconds.
